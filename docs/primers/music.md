Melody (scales), Harmony (chords), Rhythm compare with functions + primitives
Composition (canon, counterpoint, serial, etc.) compare with frameworks?
Instruments, different ranges Scores, graphic scores, MIDI, computer music

## Rhythm

### Tempo/BPM/beat

- Human heart beat
- Signature BPMs (house 120, hip hop 90, dnb 140)

### Time signature

### Note lengths

## Instruments

Physical instruments have limited ranges of notes.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(music)

Gives us some limitations to work with, and some conventions about which
instruments go together, compliment each other. Personally, I like the sound of
physical instruments. Of course feel free to use any instruments or synthesizers
you like. A general rule of thumb is to allocate each instrument a part of the
frequency spectrum. Two bass synths will compete and neither will be defined,
whereas a bass and strings patch occupy different frequency ranges and can live
happily in a mix together.

## MIDI

[128,36,127] = [channel,note,velocity]

Channel 1 Note on: 144 Channel 1 Note off: 128

Triggering a note is 2 actions: note on + note off

Ranges channel: 128-159 note: 0-127 velocity: 0-127
