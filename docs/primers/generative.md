- the imitation of nature (mimesis), or Biomimicry

Here we explore different generative techniques/methods and how to program them
in JavaScript.

Here we define what we mean by "generative", and cover how generative processes
can be applied to creating art and music.

We'll cover how natural processes? have been applied to programming, art, music.

- Minimalism: Minimalist music usually employs repetition and layering of simple
  musical patterns to generating intricate musical textures and structures.

- Chance music, also known as aleatoric music, is a compositional technique that
  introduces elements of randomness (or indeterminism) into the compositional
  process.

- Serialism: Serialism involves using deterministic rules to control choices
  within the compositional process.

- Stochastic music refers to music whose various aspects are guided by
  probability.
