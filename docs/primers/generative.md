title: Generative

Define Generative vs. algorithmic vs. procedural

Generative: relating to or capable of production or reproduction. Having the
power or function of generating, originating, producing, or reproducing.
Denoting an approach to any field of linguistics that involves applying a finite
set of rules to linguistic input in order to produce all and only the
well-formed items of a language.

Algorithmic: expressed as or using an algorithm or computational procedure. A
set of rules for solving a problem in a finite number of steps. A sequence of
instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or perform a computation.

> Another typical approach to algorithmic composition is to specify some

> satisfy those constraints.

> – The Haskell School of Music: From Signals to Symphonies

For our purposes / working definition: A (predetermined?) process/rules we
define to create, outcome is unknown?

One way to think of it: 'possiblity space'. Without rules = infinite. By
defining rules (heuristics) we constrain this space. We can draw a circle in 1/2
seconds. Computer can draw many million. In this way, the computer can 'explore'
the possiblity space much faster.

Processes

> In general, procedures of algorithmic composition may be divided into
> knowledge-based and non-knowledge-based methods. Knowledge-based approaches
> generate their outputs often on the basis of a rule-based system which is
> formulated by if then conditions and/or constraints. Non-knowledge-based
> methods are able to autonomously derive rules from an underlying corpus and
> produce outputs that, in supervised learning, are additionally evaluated by a
> superior instance.

Different forms:

- the imitation of nature (mimesis), or Biomimicry
- Rules (e.g. Reas rules:

Minimalism: Minimalist music usually employs repetition and layering of simple
musical patterns to generating intricate musical textures and structures.

Chance music, also known as aleatoric music, is a compositional technique that
introduces elements of randomness (or indeterminism) into the compositional
process. Essential parts of chaos theory include the behavior of complex
systems, their attractors as well as different forms of self-similar structures,
above all of fractals. In a mathematical and physical context, particular states
of a system that are difficult to predict are called “chaotic.”

Serialism: Serialism involves using deterministic rules to control choices
within the compositional process.

Stochastic music refers to music whose various aspects are guided by
probability. The field of stochastics comprises probability calculus and
statistics. Stochastic processes are used to describe a sequence of random
events dependent on the time parameter (t).

Genetic algorithms as a particular class of evolutionary algorithms, i.e.
strategies modeled on natural systems, are stochastic search techniques.

Artificial neural networks are used in numerous applications; depending on the
type of ANN, they are often applied in pattern recognition, prediction,
optimization and automatic classification.

Selection/curation

No 'correct' answer (unlike a proof). Aesthetic choices. But also, functional
music (Brain.fm, etc.).

Evaluation

I'm certainly no art critic. But it's worth thinking about 'good' generative
art. Unique art/music at the push of a button, what value does it have? Useful
for evaluating what you make, regardless of others.

Is the process important, or just the result? Knowing a Jackson Pollock "I am
nature" helps us understand his painting. Not essential, but connect on a deeper
level with internal logic that's expressed, not just 'pretty pictures'.

Flip side of this is it can easily slip into pretentious technobabble, where
mundane ideas are dressed in technology.

> I make art about what confuses me – Lauren McCarthy

I love this quote, because it sums up a big part of what it's all about.
Exploring stuff to understand yourself and the world better.

Without going off the metaphysical deep end, the other aspect is soul. As an
artist (yes, it's ok to call youself that), there's a perogative to illuminate
the world, move the emotions etc. which is an essential function in society.

## Notes

- the imitation of nature (mimesis), or Biomimicry

Here we explore different generative techniques/methods and how to program them
in JavaScript.

Here we define what we mean by "generative", and cover how generative processes
can be applied to creating art and music.

We'll cover how natural processes? have been applied to programming, art, music.
