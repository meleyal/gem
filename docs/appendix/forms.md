"Primitives"

- F1: Circle
- F2: Line

## Behaviors

"Actions"

- B1: Move in a straight line
- B2: Constrain to surface
- B3: Change direction while touching another Element
- B4: Move away from an overlapping Element
- B5: Enter from the opposite edge after moving off the surface
- B6: Orient toward the direction of an Element that is touching
- B7: Deviate from the current direction

## Elements

"Primitives + Actions"

- E1: F1 + B1 + B2 + B3 + B4
- E2: F1 + B1 + B5
- E3: F2 + B1 + B3 + B5
- E4: F1 + B1 + B2 + B3
- E5: F2 + B1 + B5 + B6 + B7

## Element 1

- Form 1: Circle
- Behavior 1: Move in a straight line
- Behavior 2: Constrain to surface
- Behavior 3: Change direction while touching another element
- Behavior 4: Move away from an overlapping element

## Process 4

A rectangular surface filled with varying sizes of Element 1. Draw a line from
the centers of Elements that are touching. Set the value of the shortest
possible line to black and the longest to white, with varying grays representing
values in between.
